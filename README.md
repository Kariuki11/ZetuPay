# **Project Name: AfriFlow (or your chosen name)**

## **Overview**

AfriFlow is a fintech platform designed to give African users seamless access to global financial systems. The platform enables individuals and small businesses to receive international payments, manage their digital wallets, withdraw funds locally, and participate in global investment opportunities.

AfriFlow addresses long-standing financial barriers faced across the African continent by providing simple, affordable, and compliant cross-border payment infrastructure. Users can receive money via mobile money or cryptocurrency, buy and hold crypto assets, and invest in international stock markets at rates optimized for the African market.

By integrating payments, crypto access, and investment tools into one platform, AfriFlow aims to expand financial inclusion and empower users to earn, save, and invest without restrictions.

## **Problem Statement**

Many African users face persistent challenges when trying to participate in global commerce and investment. Traditional international payment systems often impose strict limitations on African countries, resulting in:

* Frequent account bans or freezes
* High transaction and withdrawal fees
* Long settlement delays
* Unfavorable currency conversion
* Limited support for mobile money
* Barriers to investing in global markets
* Lack of reliable crypto on-ramps and off-ramps

These challenges restrict freelancers, small businesses, and individual users from receiving payments, holding value, or investing internationally. Additionally, most existing solutions are either too expensive, difficult to access, or not designed with African financial realities in mind.
